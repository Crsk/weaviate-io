## <i class="fa-solid fa-square-chevron-right"></i>&nbsp;&nbsp;About `Get` queries

<img src={imageUrl} alt="Image alt" width="75%"/>

In many use cases, retrieving objects from a Weaviate instance may be the most common operation. 

For example, a user may want to retrieve a list of passages most closely related to the input query, or they may wish to retrieve a list of images which are most similar to another image. It may even be possible to retrieve a set of images that best match a given passage.

In Weaviate, these operations are performed using the `Get` function.

### <i class="fa-solid fa-chalkboard"></i>&nbsp;&nbsp;`Get` function syntax

![](../../tmp_images/a_person_holding_a_magnifying_glass_at_computer_screen_with_code_0_short.jpg)

The syntax of a `Get` function is as follows:

```graphql
{
  Get {
    <Class> (
      <arguments>
    ) {
      <properties>
    }
  }
}
```

To review the syntax:

- The `Class` field specifies the name of the class of objects to be retrieved. 
- The `arguments` argument specifies the search criteria to be used to retrieve the objects. 
- The `properties` argument specifies the properties of the objects to be retrieved, including any `_additional` properties.

Now let's try out some `Get` queries.

## <i class="fa-solid fa-square-chevron-right"></i>&nbsp;&nbsp;Standalone `Get` queries

<img src={imageUrl} alt="Image alt" width="75%"/>

It is possible to query Weaviate with the `Get` function without any vector search parameters.

### <i class="fa-solid fa-code"></i>&nbsp;&nbsp;Example

Take a look at this example:

```graphql
{
  Get {
    JeopardyQuestion (
      limit: 2
    ) {
      question 
      answer 
    }
  }
}
```

What results do you expect? See if you can correspond each field to the syntax. 

Then, try running the query yourself.

```json
{
  "data": {
    "Get": {
      "JeopardyQuestion": [
        {
          "answer": "Amazon.com",
          "question": "On July 16, 1995 this company made its first sale, a science textbook"
        },
        {
          "answer": "Parfait",
          "question": "The French name of this layered ice cream dessert means \"perfect\""
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

</details>

<details>
  <summary><i class="fa-solid fa-lightbulb"></i> Explain this query</summary>

In this case, Weaviate will return two objects due to the `limit:2` argument. Without this limit, Weaviate would return a maximum number according to its configuration.

As this does not apply any user-specific criteria to the search, the specific results will likely not be very useful. 

However, this may be a viable method for "sanity" checks, such as checking that you can connect to a Weaviate instance, or that at least some objects have been imported successfully.

</details>

### <i class="fa-solid fa-chalkboard"></i>&nbsp;&nbsp;`Class` and `properties`

In the above example, we specify a `Class` of `JeopardyQuestion` and `properties` of `questions` and `answer`.

That is possible because those are available as defined in the schema, as shown below:

import ShortSchema from './_snippets/academy.queries.schema.short.mdx';

<ShortSchema/>

The `Class` and `properties` fields must correspond to collections of objects that have been defined in the Weaviate schema.

The `Class` must be the name of a data object class, and the `properties` a list of properties to be retrieved.

The schema contains the `JeopardyQuestion` class, with properties: `question`, `answer` and `value`.

So, a query retrieving objects from the `Question` class could specify any of its properties such as `question`, `answer`, and `value`.

## <i class="fa-solid fa-square-chevron-right"></i>&nbsp;&nbsp;`Get` with `nearText`

<img src={imageUrl} alt="Image alt" width="75%"/>

The `nearText` parameter specifies the a text input which will be the basis for the vector search. 

This parameter is passed as an argument in the GraphQL query like below, where the `concepts` argument specifies the text input to be used for the vector search.

### <i class="fa-solid fa-code"></i>&nbsp;&nbsp;Example

Here is an example:

```graphql
{
  Get {
    JeopardyQuestion (
      limit: 2
      nearText: {
        concepts: ["Space travel in real life"],
      }
    ) {
      question 
      answer     
    }
  }
}
```

Take a look at the query, and think about the following before you view the response. 

How is this different to the earlier query? What class would the results come from? How many, and which, properties would be returned?

          "question": "It takes approximately 24,840 MPH to achieve this"
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

<details>
  <summary><i class="fa-solid fa-lightbulb"></i> Explain this query</summary>

Every vector search needs a "source" vector to form the basis of the search.

Although the `nearText` parameter is not a vector, Weaviate converts the input to a vector before performing a vector search. The results are then returned in order of their similarity to the input vector, before.

:::info `nearText` parameter requires a vectorizer!
Because text object must be converted to a vector before it can be used in a vector search, the `nearText` parameter is only available when a vectorizer module has been specified for the class.
:::

</details>

### <i class="fa-solid fa-chalkboard"></i>&nbsp;&nbsp;`arguments`

The `arguments` field is optional, but essential for performing meaningful searches. It specifies the search criteria to be used to retrieve the objects. 

This may be to specify criteria for a vector search as you see above, or using `nearVector` or `nearObject` operators. 

You can also use `arguments` to specify a filter to be applied to the results, or to provide additional constraints such as the number of limits to be returned. 

## <i class="fa-solid fa-square-chevron-right"></i>&nbsp;&nbsp;`Get` with `additional` properties

<img src={imageUrl} alt="Image alt" width="75%"/>

The `additional` field allows us to retrieve additional properties that are not defined in the schema.

### <i class="fa-solid fa-code"></i>&nbsp;&nbsp;Example

In this example, we've built on the previous example by adding the `_additional` field to the `Get` query with sub-fields. 

```graphql
{
  Get {
    JeopardyQuestion (
      limit: 2
      nearText: {
        concepts: ["Space travel in real life"],
      }
    ) {
      question 
      answer 
      _additional {
        distance
        id
      }      
    }
  }
}
```

Again, consider what the response might look like. What would the `_additional` fields of `distance` and `id` return?

          },
          "answer": "escaping the Earth's gravity (and go off into outer space, on your way to the moon, for instance)",
          "question": "It takes approximately 24,840 MPH to achieve this"
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

</details>

<details>
  <summary><i class="fa-solid fa-lightbulb"></i> Explain this query</summary>

Here, the `distance` and `id` properties contain the object's distance to the query and its unique ID respectively.

</details>

### <i class="fa-solid fa-chalkboard"></i>&nbsp;&nbsp;`_additonal` properties

The `_additional` properties make available for retrieval fields than those explicitly created as class properties.

You will also notice that the query included the `distance` property in the `_additional` field. This represents the degree of similarity (or, in this case, the *dissimilarity*) between the input vector and the vector of the object.

:::info Vector also available through `_additional`

The object vector can also be retrieved through an `_additional` field, by specifying `vector` in its sub-field. 

Note that the returned vector in many cases will be a very long list of numbers.
