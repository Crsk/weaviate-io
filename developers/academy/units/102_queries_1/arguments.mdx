<img src={imageUrl} alt="Image alt" width="75%"/>

You have already seen some arguments that are available in Weaviate, such as `limit`, or `nearVector`.

In fact, arguments in Weaviate are wide-ranging. Take a look at just some of the available operators.

### <i class="fa-solid fa-chalkboard"></i>&nbsp;&nbsp;Available arguments

Some of the available arguments are:

#### Vector search

- `nearObject`: For searching based on a particular object's vector.
- `nearVector`: For searching based on a specified vector.
- `bm25`: For performing BM25 searches.
- `hybrid`: For performing hybrid searches.
- `ask`: To retrieve a specific answer based on stored object data.

#### Filtering

- `where`: Apply a Boolean filter from which your search will be carried out.
- `limit`: Restrict the maximum objects to be retrieved.
- `sort`: For sorting non-vector search results.
- `offset`: For pagination of vector search results.

(and more!)

But we don't need to cover them all at this moment. For now, let's explore a few more of the most commonly used, powerful arguments.

<Quiz questions={varName} />

## <i class="fa-solid fa-square-chevron-right"></i>&nbsp;&nbsp;Filter data with `where`

<img src={imageUrl} alt="Image alt" width="75%"/>

A filter is a way to specify additional criteria to be applied to the results of the vector search. It is analogous to the `WHERE` clause in a SQL query, and in fact the argument in Weaviate is also called `where`.

### <i class="fa-solid fa-code"></i>&nbsp;&nbsp;Single operand example

We ran a example query like this earlier:

<details>
  <summary>See original query</summary>

```graphql
{
  Get {
    JeopardyQuestion (
      limit: 2
      nearText: {
        concepts: ["Space travel in real life"],
      }        
    ) {
      question 
      answer 
      value
      _additional {
        distance
        id
      }      
    }
  }
}
```

</details>

Which returned these answers:

<details>
  <summary><i class="fa-solid fa-radar"></i> See the JSON response</summary>

```json
{
  "data": {
    "Get": {
      "JeopardyQuestion": [
        {
          "_additional": {
            "distance": 0.15368003,
            "id": "ddcc3f06-5410-5944-85c4-3cb56ab27088"
          },
          "answer": "space shuttles",
          "question": "These transports, first sent up in 1981, lift off like a rocket & land like a plane",
          "value": 200
        },
        {
          "_additional": {
            "distance": 0.17277694,
            "id": "b1645a32-0c22-5814-8f35-58f142eadf7e"
          },
          "answer": "escaping the Earth's gravity (and go off into outer space, on your way to the moon, for instance)",
          "question": "It takes approximately 24,840 MPH to achieve this",
          "value": 0
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

</details>

So let's extend our query to now include a `where` argument that uses a `Like` operator.

```graphql
{
  Get {
    JeopardyQuestion (
      limit: 2
      nearText: {
        concepts: ["Space travel in real life"],
      }
      where: {
        path: ["question"],    
        operator: Like,  
        valueText: "*rocket*"
      }
    ) {
      question 
      answer 
      value
      _additional {
        distance
        id
      }      
    }
  }
}
```

Can you guess how you would expect the earlier response to change, if at all?

Here is the actual response:

<details>
  <summary><i class="fa-solid fa-radar"></i> See the JSON response</summary>

          "value": 400
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

</details>

<details>
  <summary><i class="fa-solid fa-lightbulb"></i> Explain this query</summary>

Observe how the results have changed. The second entry from the earlier result set (about *gravity*) have been removed as it does not contain the text `rocket` in the `question` property. 

This approach of combining a vector search with a filter is a powerful way to find objects that are similar to a given input, but also meet additional criteria as you see. And while filtering may remove some objects which might otherwise be "closer" to the query vector than the remaining ones, it provides a powerful strategy to find the most relevant objects by removing false positive.

</details>

We can apply the query to filter the data in any number of ways. For example, consider the below query:

```graphql
{
  Get {
    JeopardyQuestion (
      limit: 2
      nearText: {
        concepts: ["Space travel in real life"],
      }
      where: {
        path: ["value"],    
        operator: GreaterThan,  
        valueInt: 200
      }
    ) {
      question 
      answer 
      value
      _additional {
        distance
        id
      }      
    }
  }
}
```

How do you expect that this query will be different to the earlier queries?

Take a look at the argument under `where`. What limitations do you expect in the results?

### <i class="fa-solid fa-code"></i>&nbsp;&nbsp;`Aggreagte` with `where`

Filters work similarly with `Aggregate` queries as they do with `Get` queries, providing you with a way to limit the results of your query. 

Take a look at the below example: 

```graphql
{
  Aggregate {
    JeopardyQuestion (
      where: {
        path: ["question"],    
        operator: Like,  
        valueText: "*rocket*"   
      }
    ) {
      meta {
        count
      }      
    }
  }
}
```

Which reduces the result set by filtering them by the question's `value` property.

          }
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

</details>

<details>

## <i class="fa-solid fa-square-chevron-right"></i>&nbsp;&nbsp;Vector search parameters

<img src={imageUrl} alt="Image alt" width="75%"/>

Vector search parameters are available to further specify how to carry out each search. 

Take a look at a few of these examples.

### <i class="fa-solid fa-code"></i>&nbsp;&nbsp;`nearVector` / `nearObject`

You've already seen how to carry out vector searches with the `nearText` parameter. 

The `nearVector` and `nearObject` parameters are two other available options for carrying out vector search. 

Both `nearVector` and `nearObject` directly provides Weaviate with a source vector with which it can perform a vector search. 

In case of `nearVector`, the query must include a source vector based on which similarity will be measured. An example query might look like:

```graphql
{
  Get {
    JeopardyQuestion (
      limit: 2
      nearVector: {
        vector: <QUERY_VECTOR>
      }
    ) {
      question 
      answer 
      value
      _additional {
        distance
        id
      }      
    }
  }
}
```

Where `<QUERY_VECTOR>` is a string containing the vector as an array (e.g. `"[0.016475919634103775, -0.005134709179401398, -0.00508853979408741, ...]"`).

In case of `nearObject`, the query must include an object ID, whose vector Weaviate will retrieve as the source vector in the search. An example query might look like:

```graphql
{
  Get {
    JeopardyQuestion (
      limit: 2
      nearObject: {
        id: "03c57191-0a63-5b76-ae67-bf6d09a5de2d"
      }
    ) {
      question 
      answer 
      value
      _additional {
        distance
        id
      }      
    }
  }
}
```

:::info `nearVector` / `nearObject` availability
Both `nearVector` and `nearObject` are available in Weaviate at all times, whereas `nearText` is only available when a vectorizer module is enabled and in use. 
:::

You might use a `nearVector` query when you are using your own vectorizer, or have a library of vectors already available. A `nearObject` is a useful query for finding similar objects to an existing one. 

### <i class="fa-solid fa-code"></i>&nbsp;&nbsp;Distance thresholds

As you saw previously, vector search evaluate objects based on degrees of similarity, and as a result does not exclude any of the results.

Accordingly, it is desirable to limit the search space to exclude irrelevant objects. This can be done using a `limit` argument or distance. 

You have seen that the `limit` argument specifies the number of results. On the other hand, a threshold value such as `distance` or `certainty` specify the maximum distance (or, looked from the other direction, minimum similarity) required for objects being retrieved.

Specifying a `distance` threshold can be done like so:

```graphql
{
  Aggregate {
    JeopardyQuestion (
      nearText: {
        concepts: ["Space travel in real life"],
        distance: 0.2,
      }
    ) {
      meta {
        count
      }    
    }
  }
}
```

Think about how you expect the results to look before viewing the expected JSON output.

<details>
  <summary><i class="fa-solid fa-radar"></i> See the JSON response</summary>

```json
{
  "data": {
    "Aggregate": {
      "JeopardyQuestion": [
        {
          "meta": {
            "count": 25
          }
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

</details>

<details>
  <summary><i class="fa-solid fa-lightbulb"></i> Explain this query</summary>

The query only aggregates outputs from those within `0.2` of similarity, which results in a limited search space.

</details>

:::note Exercise: Threshold distances
Try changing the query text, and `distance` threshold to higher, or lower, values to see what happens. How many results do you get back? How many of the results seem "relevant"?
:::

In this context, `distance` measures the degree of difference. You might also see `certainty` used in some contexts. This is the opposite of `distance`, where higher values imply larger differences in meaning. 

We will cover later on what these values mean, exactly, and where they come form. But for now, remember that:

- `distance` is a measure of dissimilarity (lower is more similar), and
- `certainty` is a measure of similarity (higher is more similar)
