<img src={imageUrl} alt="Image alt" width="75%"/>

You have already seen some arguments that are available in Weaviate, such as `limit`, or `nearVector`.

In fact, arguments in Weaviate are wide-ranging. Take a look at just some of the available operators.

### <i class="fa-solid fa-chalkboard"></i>&nbsp;&nbsp;Available arguments

Some of the available arguments are:

#### Vector search

- `nearObject`: For searching based on a particular object's vector.
- `nearVector`: For searching based on a specified vector.
- `bm25`: For performing BM25 searches.
- `hybrid`: For performing hybrid searches.
- `ask`: To retrieve a specific answer based on stored object data.

#### Filtering

- `where`: Apply a Boolean filter from which your search will be carried out.
- `limit`: Restrict the maximum objects to be retrieved.
- `sort`: For sorting non-vector search results.
- `offset`: For pagination of vector search results.

(and more!)

But we don't need to cover them all at this moment. For now, let's explore a few more of the most commonly used, powerful arguments.

## <i class="fa-solid fa-square-chevron-right"></i>&nbsp;&nbsp;Filter data with `where`

<img src={imageUrl} alt="Image alt" width="75%"/>

A filter is a way to specify additional criteria to be applied to the results of the vector search. It is analogous to the `WHERE` clause in a SQL query, and in fact the argument in Weaviate is also called `where`.

### <i class="fa-solid fa-code"></i>&nbsp;&nbsp;Single operand example

We ran a example query like this earlier about space travel:

<details>
  <summary>See original query</summary>

```graphql
{
  Get {
    JeopardyQuestion (
      limit: 2
      nearText: {
        concepts: ["Space travel in real life"],
      }        
    ) {
      question 
      answer 
      value
      _additional {
        distance
        id
      }      
    }
  }
}
```

</details>

Which returned these answers:

<details>
  <summary><i class="fa-solid fa-radar"></i> See the JSON response</summary>

```json
{
  "data": {
    "Get": {
      "JeopardyQuestion": [
        {
          "_additional": {
            "distance": 0.15368003,
            "id": "ddcc3f06-5410-5944-85c4-3cb56ab27088"
          },
          "answer": "space shuttles",
          "question": "These transports, first sent up in 1981, lift off like a rocket & land like a plane",
          "value": 200
        },
        {
          "_additional": {
            "distance": 0.17277694,
            "id": "b1645a32-0c22-5814-8f35-58f142eadf7e"
          },
          "answer": "escaping the Earth's gravity (and go off into outer space, on your way to the moon, for instance)",
          "question": "It takes approximately 24,840 MPH to achieve this",
          "value": 0
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

</details>

So let's extend our query to now include a `where` argument and using a `Like` operator.

```graphql
{
  Get {
    JeopardyQuestion (
      limit: 2
      nearText: {
        concepts: ["Space travel in real life"],
      }
      where: {
        path: ["question"],    
        operator: Like,  
        valueText: "*rocket*"
      }
    ) {
      question 
      answer 
      value
      _additional {
        distance
        id
      }      
    }
  }
}
```

Can you guess how you would expect the earlier response to change, if at all?

Here is the actual response:

          "question": "He's been called the \"Father of Modern Rocketry\"",
          "value": 400
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

</details>

<details>
  <summary><i class="fa-solid fa-lightbulb"></i> Explain this query</summary>

Observe how the results have changed. The second entry from the earlier result set (about *gravity*) have been removed as it does not contain the text `rocket` in the `question` property. 

This approach of combining a vector search with a filter is a powerful way to find objects that are similar to a given input, but also meet additional criteria as you see. And while filtering may remove some objects which might otherwise be "closer" to the query vector than the remaining ones, it provides a powerful strategy to find the most relevant objects by removing false positive.

</details>

<Quiz questions={varName} />

We can apply the query to filter the data in any number of ways. For example, consider the below query:

```graphql
{
  Get {
    JeopardyQuestion (
      limit: 2
      nearText: {
        concepts: ["Space travel in real life"],
      }
      where: {
        path: ["value"],    
        operator: GreaterThan,  
        valueInt: 200
      }
    ) {
      question 
      answer 
      value
      _additional {
        distance
        id
      }      
    }
  }
}
```

How do you expect that this query will be different to the earlier queries?

```

</details>

<details>
  <summary><i class="fa-solid fa-lightbulb"></i> Explain this query</summary>

This query has been modified to only return `JeopardyQuestion` objects with a `value` greater than 200. 

Accordingly, the returned data set is very different.

### <i class="fa-solid fa-code"></i>&nbsp;&nbsp;Multiple operands example



### <i class="fa-solid fa-code"></i>&nbsp;&nbsp;`Aggreagte` with `where`


Filters work similarly with `Aggregate` queries as they do with `Get` queries, providing you with a way to limit the results of your query. 

To identify how many questions have a value of over 600, a `where` filter can be constructed as shown below:

```graphql
{
  Aggregate {
    JeopardyQuestion (
      nearText: {
        concepts: ["Seafaring technology from Scandanavia."],
        distance: 0.2
      }
      where: {
          path: ["value"],
          operator: GreaterThan,
          valueInt: 600,
      }        
      ) {
      meta {
        count
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Which reduces the result set by filtering them by the question's `value` property.

{
  "data": {
    "Aggregate": {

          "meta": {
            "count": 27
          }
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}

## <i class="fa-solid fa-square-chevron-right"></i>&nbsp;&nbsp;Distance thresholds

As you saw previously, vector search evaluate objects based on degrees of similarity, and as a result does not exclude any of the results.

Accordingly, it is desirable to limit the search space using a `limit` argument or based on distance. 

As you have seen before, the `limit` argument specifies the number of results to be retrieved. On the other hand, a threshold value such as `distance` or `certainty` specify the maximum distance (or, looked from the other direction, minimum similarity) required for objects being retrieved.

### <i class="fa-solid fa-code"></i>&nbsp;&nbsp;Examples

Specifying a `distance` threshold can be done like so:

```graphql
{
  Get {
    JeopardyQuestion (
      nearText: {
        concepts: ["Seafaring technology from Scandanavia."],
        distance: 0.15
      }
    ) {
      question 
      answer 
      _additional {
        distance
        id
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Think about how you expect the results to look before viewing the expected JSON output.

            "id": "5d9d5c8d-13e7-5791-b2f9-3724a1a1d301"
          },

          "question": "1,200-year-old Viking ships are on display at the Vikingskiphuset in this Norwegian capital"
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

:::note Exercise: Threshold distances
Try changing the query text, and `distance` threshold to higher, or lower, values to see what happens. How many results do you get back? How many of the results seem "relevant"?

## <i class="fa-solid fa-square-chevron-right"></i>&nbsp;&nbsp;Pagination

Pagination can be used to retrieve latter parts of a results set; for example results 

### <i class="fa-solid fa-code"></i>&nbsp;&nbsp;`nearVector` with pagination

### <i class="fa-solid fa-chalkboard"></i>&nbsp;&nbsp;Practical considerations

Pagination is tied to a search. Accordingly, pagination results are retrieved by obtaining search results and then discarding those results ahead of the `offset`. This can make pagination resource-intensive. 

For use-cases that require high pagination, we refer you to our [documentation on this topic](/developers/weaviate/api/graphql/filters.md#performance-and-resource-considerations--limitations).
