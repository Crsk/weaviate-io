## <i class="fa-solid fa-square-chevron-right"></i>&nbsp;&nbsp;Options for running Weaviate

<img src={imageUrl} alt="Image alt" width="75%"/>

You can run Weaviate as a managed service (Weaviate Cloud Services, or WCS), or manage your own instances using Docker or Kubernetes.

As mentioned before, the underlying Weaviate code is identical regardless of the method. There are some differences to be aware of.

### <i class="fa-solid fa-chalkboard"></i>&nbsp;&nbsp;WCS (Recommended)

[WCS, or Weaviate Cloud Services](https://console.weaviate.cloud/), is a managed SaaS service that requires no maintenance at your end.

As it is managed by Weaviate (the company - the software is not sentient... *yet*), it is the fastest way to create a new instance of Weaviate and requires the least amount of effort for the users.

Weaviate instances on WCS come pre-configured for convenience. They include a number of Weaviate "modules" by default, as well as built-in support for user authentication for security.

WCS includes a free "sandbox" tier, which is our recommend method of running Weaviate throughout this course unless otherwise specified.

### <i class="fa-solid fa-chalkboard"></i>&nbsp;&nbsp;Docker / Kubernetes

You can run Weaviate instances using containerization solutions such as [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/) and/or [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/docs/home/).

This provides you with the same code base as one that is used in WCS, although you will need to manage its configuration and deployment yourself.

Self-managed set ups using Docker or Kubernetes will be discussed in standalone, separate units in the future.

If you are familiar with either solutions and would prefer to install Weaviate through them, we refer you to our documentation for installation with [Docker-Compose](/developers/weaviate/installation/docker-compose.md) or [Kubernetes](/developers/weaviate/installation/kubernetes.md).

You can communicate with Weaviate with the available [client libraries](/developers/weaviate/client-libraries/index.md) or directly with the [RESTful API](/developers/weaviate/api/rest/index.md) and the [GraphQL API](/developers/weaviate/api/graphql/index.md).

## <i class="fa-solid fa-square-chevron-right"></i>&nbsp;&nbsp;Install Weaviate client

:::info Academy material in Python
For the initial release of Weaviate Academy units, our materials are written around Python examples.<br/><br/>
But we are working to add versions for other clients, starting with TypeScript/JavaScript examples. We appreciate your patience as we build up our educational material.
