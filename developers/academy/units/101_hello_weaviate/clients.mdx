## The role of clients

import imageUrl from '../../tmp_images/academy_placeholder.jpg';

<img src={imageUrl} alt="Image alt" width="75%"/>

You can communicate with Weaviate with the available [client libraries](/developers/weaviate/client-libraries/index.md) or directly with the [RESTful API](/developers/weaviate/api/rest/index.md) and the [GraphQL API](/developers/weaviate/api/graphql/index.md).

### Available clients

Currently, Weaviate clients are available in: 

- <i class="fa-brands fa-python"></i> Python
- <i class="fa-brands fa-js"></i> JavaScript
- <i class="fa-brands fa-java"></i> Java 
- <i class="fa-brands fa-golang"></i> Go

### Client capabilities

## Installation

Install your preferred client by following the relevant instructions below:

import CodeClientInstall from '/_includes/code/quickstart.clients.install.mdx';

<CodeClientInstall />

## Getting started with the client

Earlier on, you saw how to send requests to Weaviate using its REST API and the GraphQL API. Weaviate clients allow you to abstract these so that you can integrate Weaviate to your preferred workflow. 

Let's take a look at a few examples to see this behavior in action.

### Client instantiation

A `client` object can be instantiated for convenient access to your instance of Weaviate. In each language, the class constructor allows you to set the following (note that the parameter names may vary across libraries):

#### Host URL (required): 

This is the location of your Weaviate instance, such as `https://example.weaviate.network`

#### Authentication information (optional)

If authentication is enabled, you MUST provide your authentication information here. Otherwise the Weaviate instance will not provide access.

:::note WCS authentication
We suggested that for convenience, you disable authentication for these tutorials. However, if you did enable authentication for your WCS sandbox, you can provide your WCS username and password as shown when instantiating your `client` object.
:::

#### Additional headers (optional)

You can provide additional headers here. This is used to provide API keys for inference services such as Cohere, Hugging Face or OpenAI. 

#### Code examples

Putting it together, a client can be instantiated in each respective language as below:

import ClientInstantiationCode from './_snippets/academy.hello.client.instantiation.mdx';

<ClientInstantiationCode/>

:::note API keys
In your own code, you would only need to specify the API keys for the service(s) that you are using.

### Accessing the REST API

The REST API can be accessed using client libraries

## Review

Each section should have a quick recap/review video of about a minute.

### Review exercise

**Aspirational section.** Would like to have the user provide a freeform input, and get back a similarity score and our definition.
