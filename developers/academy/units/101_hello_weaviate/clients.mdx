You can communicate with Weaviate with the available [client libraries](/developers/weaviate/client-libraries/index.md) or directly with the [RESTful API](/developers/weaviate/api/rest/index.md) and the [GraphQL API](/developers/weaviate/api/graphql/index.md).

### <i class="fa-solid fa-chalkboard"></i>&nbsp;&nbsp;Available clients

Currently, Weaviate clients are available in: 

- <i class="fa-brands fa-python"></i> Python
- <i class="fa-brands fa-js"></i> JavaScript
- <i class="fa-brands fa-java"></i> Java 
- <i class="fa-brands fa-golang"></i> Go

<img src={imageUrl} alt="Image alt" width="75%"/>

Weaviate clients allow you to abstract communications with the Weaviate API, so that you can integrate Weaviate to your preferred workflow. 

Let's take a look at a few examples to see this behavior in action.

### <i class="fa-solid fa-code"></i>&nbsp;&nbsp;Client instantiation

A `client` object can be instantiated for convenient access to your instance of Weaviate. In each language, the you can set the following parameters:

:::note
Parameter names may vary across libraries
:::

#### Host URL (required): 

This is the location of your Weaviate instance, such as `https://example.weaviate.network`

#### Authentication information (optional)

If authentication is enabled, you MUST provide your authentication information here. Otherwise the Weaviate instance will not provide access.

:::tip WCS authentication
We suggested that for convenience, you disable authentication for these tutorials. However, if you did enable authentication for your WCS sandbox, you can provide your WCS username and password as shown when instantiating your `client` object.
:::

#### Additional headers (optional)

You can provide additional headers here. This is used to provide API keys for inference services such as Cohere, Hugging Face or OpenAI. 

#### Code examples

Putting it together, a client can be instantiated in each respective language as below:

<!-- TODO - add client code examples -->

import ClientInstantiationCode from './_snippets/academy.hello.client.instantiation.mdx';

<ClientInstantiationCode/>

:::tip API keys
In your own code, you would only need to specify the API keys for the service(s) that you are using. 
:::

### <i class="fa-solid fa-code"></i>&nbsp;&nbsp;Accessing the REST API

The REST API can be accessed using client libraries. As a result, an HTTP request like this:

```http
GET https://some-endpoint.weaviate.network/v1/objects/WikiArticle/36ddd591-2dee-4e7e-a3cc-eb86d30a4303
```

Will become:

import ClientRESTObjectGet from './_snippets/academy.clients.rest.object.get.mdx';

<ClientRESTObjectGet />

### <i class="fa-solid fa-code"></i>&nbsp;&nbsp;Accessing the GraphQL API

Similarly, a GraphQL query like this:

```graphql
{
  Get {
    WikiArticle {
      title
      wiki_summary
    }
  }
}
```

Can be abstracted to:

import ClientGraphqlGet from './_snippets/academy.clients.graphql.get.mdx';

<ClientGraphqlGet />

### <i class="fa-solid fa-code"></i>&nbsp;&nbsp;Clients in Weaviate Academy

Depending on the concepts that we are learning, we may provide code examples for respective clients. 

In some units, we may primarily focus on raw queries (e.g. GraphQL or REST) in order to establish a common conceptual framework, before moving on to client-based queries. 

For those cases, we recommend running raw GraphQL queries through your client, as shown in the below examples:

import ClientGraphqlRaw from '../../_snippets/academy.clients.graphql.raw.mdx';

<ClientGraphqlRaw />

<Quiz questions={clientCapabilities} />

## <i class="fa-solid fa-square-chevron-right"></i>&nbsp;&nbsp;Weaviate Console

You can use the [Weaviate Console](https://console.weaviate.io/) to directly query a Weaviate instance, whether it is on the cloud (e.g. WCS), or a local instance. The Console provides a graphical interface through which you can directly enter a GraphQL query and see results.

:::note Weaviate Console & OIDC
Currently, it is not possible to pass an OIDC token through Weaviate Console.

Each section should have a quick recap/review video of about a minute.

**Aspirational section.** Would like to have the user provide a freeform input, and get back a similarity score and our definition.
