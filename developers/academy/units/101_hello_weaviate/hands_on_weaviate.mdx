## Vectors in action

:::warning TODO

:::

You have learned a lot already about vector searches. You have learned what vectors are, how they can represent meaning, and how vector searches can leverage these representations to perform similarity-based searches. 

In this lab, you will start to take that theory to practice and try vector searches in action by searching through our demo database of quiz questions and categories. You will learn how to use Weaviate to retrieve objects based on their similarity, using various query types such as an input text, vector, or object. 

You will also compare vector search with keyword search to compare and contrast the two techniques, before learning how to combine the two techniques through the use of filters.

### Vector search in action

![](../../tmp_images/students_looking_at_computer_screen_with_code_0.png)

For our first search, let's look for categories that best match our input query. The "Category" class in the Weaviate instance [DEMO INSTANCE LOCATION](http://example.com) is populated with categories that each question belongs to. 

The below has been set up so that it would retrieve the closest categories to the input query "Ground-breaking scientific discovery". Try running it yourself:

:::warning TODO
- Replace instance location ABOVE with actual instance
- Replace query ABOVE with actual query
- Pre-set QUERY here (show results when user hits GO)
- Should be something where the results don't have literal matches
:::

Note that the results are very much conceptually relevant even though they don't have much in the way of literal overlap with our query. This is exactly what we have been learning about - vector searches can identify related objects. What we have not yet seen however, is the syntax. So let's dive into that a little bit.

### Vector similarities in action

Show similar demo to above, but this time retrieve similarities - possibly visualize them?

### Vector searching vs keyword searching in action

Show how hard it might be to replicate the above just with keyword searching.

## Beyond vector searching

Show a little taste of what else Weaviate can do in additon ot vector searching
