## What is Weaviate?

:::warning TODO

:::

As you may have read on [our homepage](https://weaviate.io/), Weaviate is an open-source vector search engine. 

That's a short sentence that packs a lot of information. So let's spend some time unpacking it here, bit by bit.

### Vector search engine

![](../../tmp_images/person_holding_a_magnifying_glass_in_front_of_a_big_pile_of_numbers_1.jpg)

Weaviate is a fantastic tool for retrieving the information you need, quickly and accurately. It does this by being an amazing **vector search engine**.

A vector search engine is an advanced type of search engine that helps you to retrieve information using "vectors". 

Unlike traditional search engines, which return results based on keyword matches, vector search engines return results based on comparisons of vectors, each of which represents an object like a passage of text, a book, or an image. A vector search is a **fantastic way of carrying out a similarity-based search**. 

A vector search is also referred to as a "semantic search", because it returns results based on similarity of meaning (therefore "semantic").

Think of it like searching for a book in a library. Instead of searching for a particular word, like "history", or "penguins" a vector search engines enables searches for books that are similar in theme, tone, or style.

Take a look for yourself at this example of a vector search:

Weaviate can help you to do this, and actually a lot more. Another way to think about Weaviate is that it supercharges the way you use information. 

#### Information, made dynamic

We are used to thinking of information as static, like a book. But modern AI and language models allows us to do much more than that. With Weaviate, you can not only identify and retrieve your existing information, but easily build on top of it.

For example, you can extract answers to questions using Weaviate:

Or you can synthesise passages using retrieved information with Weaviate:

We will cover these and many more capabilities, such as vectorization, summarization and classification, in our units. For now, keep in mind that Weaviate is a vector search engine at its core which can also leverage AI tools to do more with the retrieved information.

### Open-source

![](../../tmp_images/a_crowd_looking_at_many_many_lines_of_computer_code_1.jpg)

Weaviate is open-source. In other words, its [codebase is available online](https://github.com/weaviate/weaviate) for anyone to see and use<sup>[(1)](#1)</sup>. 

And that is *the* codebase, regardless of how you use it. So whether you run Weaviate on your own computer, on a cloud compute environment, or through our managed service [Weaviate Cloud Service, or WCS](https://console.weaviate.io/), you are using the exact same technology.

It also means that your knowledge about Weaviate is fungible, between local, cloud or managed instances of Weaviate. So anything you learn here about Weaviate using WCS will be equally applicable to running it locally, and vice versa. ðŸ˜‰

## How does Weaviate work?

:::warning TODO
Video here
:::

Weaviate enables vector searches by indexing and storing data objects and corresponding vector embeddings from machine learning models. 

In more plain terms, Weaviate processes and organizes your data in such a way that objects can be retrieved based on their similarity to a query. 

There are a few factors here that are important to point out.

### Quantifying similarity

![](../../tmp_images/confused_person_holding_documents_on_either_hand_0.jpg)

As we've mentioned, vector searches are similarity-based, but what does that actually mean? How do we determine that two pieces of data are "similar"? What does it mean for two vectors, two pieces of text, or two objects in general, to be similar?

This is a relatively simple idea that is actually incredibly interesting and intricate once we start to dive into the details. 

But for now, you should know that machine learning (ML) models are key to this whole process, and it is important to select the right model for the job. We will cover this in more detail later on. 

## Review

In this section, you learned about what Weaviate is and how it works at a very high level. You have also been introduced to what vector search is at a high level, that it is a similarity-based search method. 

### Review exercise

Can you describe, in your own sentence, what vector search is?

### Key takeaways

- Weaviate is an open source vector search engine.
- The core Weaviate library the same whether you run it locally, on the cloud, or with WCS.
- Vector searches are similarity-based searches.
- Machine learning models are used to vectorize objects, and in turn define what it means for objects to be "similar".
- Vector databases such as Weaviate include a vector index as well as an inverted index.
