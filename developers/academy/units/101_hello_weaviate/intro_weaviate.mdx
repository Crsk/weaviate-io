Weaviate is an open-source vector database. But what does that mean? Let's unpack it here.

### <i class="fa-solid fa-chalkboard"></i>&nbsp;&nbsp;Vector database

![](../../tmp_images/person_holding_a_magnifying_glass_in_front_of_a_big_pile_of_numbers_1.jpg)

Weaviate is a fantastic tool for retrieving the information you need, quickly and accurately. It does this by being an amazing **vector database**.

A vector database can store and retrieves information based on similarity. This is different to traditional databases and retrieval strategies, for example those that rely on SQL.

#### How traditional searches work

Imagine that you are searching a relational database for books related to birds. Maybe you are a bird-watcher, or perhaps you're an ornithologist (bird scientist). Using SQL, you might construct a query like this: 

```sql
SELECT title, author, summary
FROM books 
WHERE title LIKE '%bird%'
    OR title LIKE '%avian%'
    OR title LIKE '%ornithology%'
    OR title LIKE '%ornithological%'
    OR title LIKE '%fowl%'
    OR title LIKE '%feathered friend%'
    OR title LIKE '%winged wonder%'
    OR title LIKE '%feathery creature%'
    OR title LIKE '%avifauna%'
```

Which would return books that contained any of these strings (`bird`, `avian`, `ornithology`, ... etc) in the `title`. 

#### Limitations of traditional search

There are two main challenges with this approach.

Here, you must identify all terms that have been used with the topic. Otherwise, the search would miss any entities that didn't include any of these terms.

What's more, this doesn't solve the problem of how to rank, or sort, the list of resulting books. Based on your search, a book like *"The Birdie Book. A Miscellany Of Golf"* (irrelevant) is given equal weighting to *"What It's Like to Be a Bird"* (highly relevant). 

A vector database makes this job simpler by enabling searches based on similarity. 

#### Examples of vector search

So, you could perform a query like this in Weaviate:

```graphql
{
  Get {
    Book (
      nearText: { concepts: ["birds"] }
    ) { title author summary }
  }
}
```

And it would return a list of books that are *ranked by their similarity* to the query - the idea of "birds". 

Weaviate can help you to do this, and actually a lot more. Another way to think about Weaviate is that it supercharges the way you use information. 

:::info Vector vs semantic search
A vector search is also referred to as a "semantic search" because it returns results based on the similarity of meaning (therefore "semantic").

### <i class="fa-solid fa-chalkboard"></i>&nbsp;&nbsp;Open-source

![](../../tmp_images/a_crowd_looking_at_many_many_lines_of_computer_code_1.jpg)

Weaviate is open-source. In other words, its [codebase is available online](https://github.com/weaviate/weaviate) for anyone to see and use<sup>[(1)](#1)</sup>. 

And that is *the* codebase, regardless of how you use it. So whether you run Weaviate on your own computer, on a cloud computing environment, or through our managed service [Weaviate Cloud Service, or WCS](https://console.weaviate.io/), you are using the exact same technology.

It also means that your knowledge about Weaviate is fungible, between local, cloud, or managed instances of Weaviate. So anything you learn here about Weaviate using WCS will be equally applicable to running it locally, and vice versa. ðŸ˜‰

### <i class="fa-solid fa-chalkboard"></i>&nbsp;&nbsp;Information, made dynamic

We are used to thinking of information as static, like a book. But modern AI and language models allow us to do much more than that. With Weaviate, you can not only identify and retrieve your existing information but easily build on top of it. Take a look at these examples:

#### Question answering

Given a list of Wikipedia entries, you could ask Weaviate: 

:::note We asked Weaviate:
When was Lewis Hamilton born?
:::

And it would answer with: 

:::note Weaviate responded:
Lewis Hamilton was born on January 7, 1985. ([check for yourself](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lewis_Hamilton))

          },
          "title": "Lewis Hamilton"
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

#### Generative search

Or you can synthesize passages using retrieved information with Weaviate:

Here is one, where we searched Weaviate for an entry on a "racing driver", and produce the result in the format of:

:::note We asked Weaviate:
Write a fun tweet encouraging people to read about this: ## {title} by summarizing highlights from: ## {wiki_summary}
:::

Which produces:

:::note Weaviate responded:
Check out the amazing story of Lewis Hamilton, the 7-time Formula One World Drivers' Championship winner! From his humble beginnings to becoming one of the world's most influential people, his journey is an inspiring one. #LewisHamilton #FormulaOne #Motorsport #Racing

          "wiki_summary": "Sir Lewis Carl Davidson Hamilton   (born 7 January 1985) is a British racing driver currently competing in Formula One, driving for Mercedes-AMG Petronas Formula One Team. In Formula One, Hamilton has won a joint-record seven World Drivers' Championship titles (tied with Michael Schumacher), and holds the records for the most wins (103), pole positions (103), and podium finishes (191), among others.\nBorn and raised in Stevenage, Hertfordshire, Hamilton joined the McLaren young driver programme in 1998 at the age of 13, becoming the youngest racing driver ever to be contracted by a Formula One team. This led to a Formula One drive with McLaren for six years from 2007 to 2012, making Hamilton the first black driver to race in the series. In his inaugural season, Hamilton set numerous records as he finished runner-up to Kimi R\u00e4ikk\u00f6nen by one point. The following season, he won his maiden title in dramatic fashion\u2014making a crucial overtake at the last corner on the last lap of the last race of the season\u2014to become the then-youngest Formula One World Champion in history.  After six years with McLaren, Hamilton signed with Mercedes in 2013.\nChanges to the regulations for 2014 mandating the use of turbo-hybrid engines saw the start of a highly successful period for Hamilton, during which he won six further drivers' titles. Consecutive titles came in 2014 and 2015 during an intense rivalry with teammate Nico Rosberg. Following Rosberg's retirement in 2016, Ferrari's Sebastian Vettel became Hamilton's closest rival in two championship battles, in which Hamilton twice overturned mid-season point deficits to claim consecutive titles again in 2017 and 2018. His third and fourth consecutive titles followed in 2019 and 2020 to equal Schumacher's record of seven drivers' titles. Hamilton achieved his 100th pole position and race win during the 2021 season. \nHamilton has been credited with furthering Formula One's global following by appealing to a broader audience outside the sport, in part due to his high-profile lifestyle, environmental and social activism, and exploits in music and fashion. He has also become a prominent advocate in support of activism to combat racism and push for increased diversity in motorsport. Hamilton was the highest-paid Formula One driver from 2013 to 2021, and was ranked as one of the world's highest-paid athletes by Forbes of twenty-tens decade and 2021. He was also listed in the 2020 issue of Time as one of the 100 most influential people globally, and was knighted in the 2021 New Year Honours. Hamilton was granted honorary Brazilian citizenship in 2022.\n\n"

We will cover these and many more capabilities, such as vectorization, summarization and classification, in our units. 

For now, keep in mind that Weaviate is a vector database at its core which can also leverage AI tools to do more with the retrieved information.

## <i class="fa-solid fa-square-chevron-right"></i>&nbsp;&nbsp;How does Weaviate work?

<img src={imageUrl} alt="Image alt" width="75%"/>

Weaviate enables vector searches by indexing and storing data objects and corresponding vector embeddings from machine learning models. 

In plain terms, Weaviate processes and organizes your data in such a way that objects can be retrieved based on their similarity to a query. 

There are a few factors here that are important to point out.

### <i class="fa-solid fa-chalkboard"></i>&nbsp;&nbsp;Quantifying similarity

![](../../tmp_images/confused_person_holding_documents_on_either_hand_0.jpg)

As we've mentioned, vector searches are similarity-based, but what does that actually mean? How do we determine that two pieces of data are "similar"? What does it mean for two vectors, two pieces of text, or two objects in general, to be similar?

This is a relatively simple idea that is actually incredibly interesting and intricate once we start to dive into the details. 

But for now, you should know that machine learning (ML) models are key to this whole process, and it is important to select the right model for the job. We will cover this in more detail later on. 

### <i class="fa-solid fa-chalkboard"></i>&nbsp;&nbsp;Indexing data

Vector searches can be very computationally intensive. 

To overcome this problem, Weaviate uses a combination of indexes including an approximate nearest neighbor (ANN) index and an inverted index. They respectively allow Weaviate to perform extremely fast vector searches, as well as to filter data using Boolean criteria on data.

We will get into this in more detail later - but for now, it's enough to know that Weaviate can perform fast vector searches as well as filtering.

## <i class="fa-solid fa-square-chevron-right"></i>&nbsp;&nbsp;Review

In this section, you learned about what Weaviate is and how it works at a very high level. You have also been introduced to what vector search is at a high level, that it is a similarity-based search method. 

### <i class="fa-solid fa-pen-to-square"></i>&nbsp;&nbsp;Review exercise

Can you describe, in your own sentence, what vector search is?
