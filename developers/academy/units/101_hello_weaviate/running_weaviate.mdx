## <i class="fa-solid fa-square-chevron-right"></i>&nbsp;&nbsp;Options for running Weaviate

<img src={imageUrl} alt="Image alt" width="75%"/>

You can run Weaviate with our managed clusters (WCS), or manage your own instances using Docker or Kubernetes. 

As mentioned before, the underlying Weaviate code is identical regardless of the method. There are some differences to be aware of.

### <i class="fa-solid fa-chalkboard"></i>&nbsp;&nbsp;WCS (Recommended)

[WCS, or Weaviate Cloud Services](https://console.weaviate.io/), is a managed SaaS service that requires no maintenance at your end. 

As it is managed by Weaviate (the company - the software is not sentient... *yet*), it is the fastest way to create a new instance of Weaviate and requires the least amount of effort for the users.

Weaviate instances on WCS come pre-configured for convenience. They include a number of Weaviate "modules" by default, as well as built-in support for user authentication for security.

WCS includes a free "sandbox" tier, which is our recommend method of running Weaviate throughout this course unless otherwise specified.

### <i class="fa-solid fa-chalkboard"></i>&nbsp;&nbsp;Docker / Kubernetes

You can run Weaviate instances using containerization solutions such as [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/) and/or [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/docs/home/). 

This provides you with the same code base as one that is used in WCS, although you will need to manage its configuration and deployment yourself. 

Self-managed set ups using Docker or Kubernetes is slightly outside the scope of the core group of units, and will be discussed in standalone, separate units in the future.

If you are familiar with either solutions and would prefer to install Weaviate through them, we refer you to our documentation for installation with [Docker-Compose](/developers/weaviate/installation/docker-compose.md) or [Kubernetes](/developers/weaviate/installation/kubernetes.md).

:::note
To be completed later; especially given ongoing WCS upgrades
:::

### <i class="fa-solid fa-code"></i>&nbsp;&nbsp;Sign up to WCS

- Show how to visit WCS site
- Show how to create a new account 

### <i class="fa-solid fa-code"></i>&nbsp;&nbsp;Start an instance

:::tip WCS authentication
We suggest that for convenience, you disable authentication for these tutorials.
:::

- Discuss different tiers & options
- Use sandbox tier to create instance
- Take users through cluster creation options
- Discuss Authentication (suggest disabling for tutorial)

:::info Authentication
- Briefly touch on authentication
  - What is it (vs authorization)
  - Why does WCS have it
  - Why OIDC
:::

### <i class="fa-solid fa-code"></i>&nbsp;&nbsp;Import demo data

- Direct users to a web-based app / WCS button to import data

## <i class="fa-solid fa-square-chevron-right"></i>&nbsp;&nbsp;Send requests to Weaviate APIs

Weaviate provides REST and GraphQL API interfaces for communication. Let's take a look at some examples of sending requests to Weaviate using both interfaces.

### <i class="fa-solid fa-code"></i>&nbsp;&nbsp;REST API requests

- Show how to make API calls to Weaviate
  - REST endpoints
    - `meta`
    - `nodes`
    - `schema` (empty)

### <i class="fa-solid fa-code"></i>&nbsp;&nbsp;GraphQL requests

  - GraphQL
    - `Get` query (empty)

:::info Authentication
- Show that endpoints not accessible without Auth
- Except `well-known`

Each section should have a quick recap/review video of about a minute.

### <i class="fa-solid fa-pen-to-square"></i>&nbsp;&nbsp;Review exercise

**Aspirational section.** Would like to have the user provide a freeform input, and get back a similarity score and our definition.

:::info TODO
Can you describe, in your own sentence, XXX?
