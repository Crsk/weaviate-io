## Options for running Weaviate

<img src={imageUrl} alt="Image alt" width="75%"/>

You can run Weaviate with our managed clusters (WCS), or manage your own instances using Docker or Kubernetes. 

As mentioned before, the underlying Weaviate code is identical regardless of the method. There are some differences to be aware of.

### WCS (Recommended)

[WCS, or Weaviate Cloud Services](https://console.weaviate.io/), is a managed SaaS service that requires no maintenance at your end. 

As it is managed by Weaviate (the company), it is the fastest way to create a new instance of Weaviate and requires the least amount of effort. 

Weaviate instances on WCS come pre-configured for convenience. They include a number of Weaviate "modules" by default, as well as built-in support for user authentication for security. 

WCS includes a free "sandbox" tier, which is our recommend method of running Weaviate throughout this course unless otherwise specified. 

### Docker / Kubernetes

You can run Weaviate instances using containerization solutions such as [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/) and/or [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/docs/home/). 

This provides you with the same code base as one that is used in WCS, although you will need to manage its configuration and deployment yourself. 

Self-managed set ups using Docker or Kubernetes is slightly outside the scope of the core group of units, and will be discussed in standalone, separate units in the future.

If you are familiar with either solutions and would prefer to install Weaviate through them, we refer you to our documentation for installation with [Docker-Compose](/developers/weaviate/installation/docker-compose.md) or [Kubernetes](/developers/weaviate/installation/kubernetes.md).

## Get started with WCS

:::note
To be completed later; especially given ongoing WCS upgrades
:::

### Sign up to WCS

- Show how to visit WCS site
- Show how to create a new account 

### Start an instance

- Discuss different tiers & options
- Use sandbox tier to create instance
- Take users through cluster creation options
- Discuss Authentication (suggest disabling for tutorial)

:::info Authentication
- Briefly touch on authentication
  - What is it (vs authorization)
  - Why does WCS have it
  - Why OIDC
:::

### Import demo data

- Direct users to a web-based app / WCS button to import data

### Send requests to Weaviate APIs

- Show how to make API calls to Weaviate
- REST endpoints
  - `meta`
  - `nodes`
  - `schema` (empty)
- GraphQL
  - `Get` query (empty)

:::info Authentication
- Show that endpoints not accessible without Auth
- Except `well-known`

## Review

Each section should have a quick recap/review video of about a minute.

### Review exercise

**Aspirational section.** Would like to have the user provide a freeform input, and get back a similarity score and our definition.
