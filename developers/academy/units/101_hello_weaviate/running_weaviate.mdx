## <i class="fa-solid fa-square-chevron-right"></i>&nbsp;&nbsp;Options for running Weaviate

<img src={imageUrl} alt="Image alt" width="75%"/>

You can run Weaviate with our managed clusters (WCS), or manage your own instances using Docker or Kubernetes. 

As mentioned before, the underlying Weaviate code is identical regardless of the method. There are some differences to be aware of.

### <i class="fa-solid fa-chalkboard"></i>&nbsp;&nbsp;WCS (Recommended)

[WCS, or Weaviate Cloud Services](https://console.weaviate.io/), is a managed SaaS service that requires no maintenance at your end. 

As it is managed by Weaviate (the company - the software is not sentient... *yet*), it is the fastest way to create a new instance of Weaviate and requires the least amount of effort for the users.

Weaviate instances on WCS come pre-configured for convenience. They include a number of Weaviate "modules" by default, as well as built-in support for user authentication for security.

WCS includes a free "sandbox" tier, which is our recommend method of running Weaviate throughout this course unless otherwise specified.

### <i class="fa-solid fa-chalkboard"></i>&nbsp;&nbsp;Docker / Kubernetes

You can run Weaviate instances using containerization solutions such as [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/) and/or [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/docs/home/). 

This provides you with the same code base as one that is used in WCS, although you will need to manage its configuration and deployment yourself. 

Self-managed set ups using Docker or Kubernetes is slightly outside the scope of the core group of units, and will be discussed in standalone, separate units in the future.

If you are familiar with either solutions and would prefer to install Weaviate through them, we refer you to our documentation for installation with [Docker-Compose](/developers/weaviate/installation/docker-compose.md) or [Kubernetes](/developers/weaviate/installation/kubernetes.md).

## <i class="fa-solid fa-square-chevron-right"></i>&nbsp;&nbsp;Send requests to Weaviate APIs

Weaviate provides two API interfaces - REST and GraphQL. They work together to provide a rich API for its users.

The **REST API** is used to interact with Weaviate for CRUD (Create, Read, Update and Delete) operations and to obtain metadata about the database. 

The **GraphQL API** is used to interact with Weaviate for data searches. More specifically, it can be used to retrieve data objects, aggregate information, and explore vector spaces.

<details>
  <summary>What is REST?</summary>

REST is an acronym for **RE**presentational **S**tate **T**ransfer. 

A REST API provides multiple endpoints, each with its own URL, that can be used to interact with the API. 

The endpoints are organized into a hierarchy, with each endpoint representing a resource. The client can then request information about these resources by sending a request to the server.

</details>

<details>
  <summary>What is GraphQL?</summary>

GraphQL is a query language for APIs. 

First released by Facebook in 2015, it is now maintained by the GraphQL Foundation. 

GraphQL is a specification for a query language that can be used to request information from a server. GraphQL is a **strongly typed** language, which means that the client must specify the type of data that it wants to receive.

</details>

Let's take a look at some examples of sending requests to Weaviate using both interfaces.
