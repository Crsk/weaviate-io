## GraphQL in Weaviate

### Basic GraphQL syntax structure

You may have already seen that Weaviate utilizes GraphQL as the query language for its searches.

GraphQL allows the user to specify the data to retrieve. This allows the user to only specify the data that is needed. Additionally, the user can specify multiple properties, which means that what might potentially take multiple requests with a REST API can be done in a single query. 

The ability of GraphQL to reduce over-fetching and under-fetching of data is a key reason that it is used by Weaviate.

Let's take a look at the basic GraphQL syntax in Weaviate again.  

```graphql
{
  <Function> {
    <Class> {
      <properties>
      _additional {
        <additional_properties>
      }
    }
  }
}
```

If you were to query a database of quiz objects, the fields in the above query would be as follows:

* `<Function>`: The function that you want to use, such as `Get`, `Aggregate`, or `Explore`.
* `<Class>`: The class that you want to retrieve data from, such as `Question` or `Category`.
* `<properties>`: The properties that you want to retrieve, such as `question`, `answer` or `value`.
* `<additional_properties>`: The properties that you want to retrieve from the additional properties, such as `id` or `vector`.

Each field can also accept arguments, such as `limit` to limit the number of objects to be returned, or `where` to apply a filter. 

### GraphQL and Weaviate clients

Weaviate offers client libraries for multiple widely used programming languages in Python, JavaScript, Java, and Go. These client libraries simplify the use of GraphQL syntax by allowing interaction with Weaviate using constructs of the respective native programming language.

The client libraries also give the option to use raw GraphQL queries directly.

In this section, we'll continue to use raw GraphQL queries to deepen your understanding and increase your comfort level with this crucial topic.

### GraphQL in requests

We note that each GraphQL query which is sent to the endpoint takes the below form. The GraphQL query is provided as the value to the `query` key in the JSON payload.

```json
{
    "query": "{ # GRAPHQL QUERY }"
}
```

For our purposes, however, we will only need to construct the query body and pass it to the GraphQL console, or to an appropriate client as the raw query.

## Overview of GraphQL API

:::warning TODO
Intro video here
:::

The available GraphQL functions in Weaviate are `Get`, `Aggregate` and `Explore`. These three functions are used to `Get` objects, `Aggregate` information and `Explore` vector spaces. 

Let's review each one briefly, before we learn about them in detail in the following sections.

### `Get` objects

You might have seen this function in the earlier, introductory, unit. The `Get` function is used in Weaviate to retrieve data objects. For many use cases, `Get` will be the most common type of query function used in Weaviate.

Try the following query, for example:

```graphql
{
  Get {
    Question (limit: 1) {
      question
      answer
    }
  }
}
```

This query applies the `Get` function on the `Question` class, with an argument `limit: 1` which limits the number of returned objects to a maximum of 1. 

It should produce a response look like the following:

```json
{
  "data": {
    "Get": {
      "Question": [
        {
          "answer": "Amazon.com",
          "question": "On July 16, 1995 this company made its first sale, a science textbook"
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

You can see that the response includes a data object from the `Question` class, and values of its `question` and `answer` properties. 

:::info GraphQL formatting tips
For the most part GraphQL is very flexible in terms of formatting, such that [whitespaces](https://spec.graphql.org/October2021/#sec-White-Space) and [commas](https://spec.graphql.org/October2021/#sec-Insignificant-Commas) are typically insignificant. For instance, the above query could have been written as the following:
```graphql
{Get{Question(limit:1){question answer}}}
```

Or even (notice the comma):
```graphql
{Get{Question(limit:1){question,answer}}}
```
:::


### `Aggregate` information

Whereas `Get` returns objects, `Aggregate` returns summary statistics or aggregates from the result set. 

This allows retrieval of calculations on a set of values to return a single value, or summary value produced based on groups of outputs. 

For example, the following query will produce a number of statistical values in relation to the `value` property in the `Question` class.

```graphql
{
  Aggregate {
    Question (limit: 100) {
      value {
        minimum
        maximum
        mean
      }
    }
  }
}
```

It should produce a response that looks like the following:

```json
{
  "data": {
    "Aggregate": {
      "Question": [
        {
          "value": {
            "maximum": 10000,
            "mean": 632.41,
            "minimum": 0
          }
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

### `Explore` vector spaces

`Explore` is a powerful function in Weaviate that allows you to navigate the entire vector space. 

This means that you can use `Explore` to find objects that are similar to a given object or vector, regardless of the class of the object. As such, `Explore` is very useful when you may not be sure of what class to search for.

In relation to our Quiz dataset, a query using the `Explore` function would return a set of objects from both the `Question` and `Category` classes.

We will explore the `Explore` function in more detail in a following unit.

## Query arguments

:::warning TODO
Intro video here
:::

You've already seen that GraphQL queries can take arguments such as `limit`. In this section, we'll take a closer look at the arguments that are available for each function. 

### Argument syntax in GraphQL

Arguments are provided in GraphQL as a comma-separated list of key-value pairs, enclosed in parentheses. Recall the following example for the `Get` function, where we provided the limit argument:

```graphql
{
  Get {
    Question (limit: 1) {
      question
      answer
    }
  }
}
```

We can introduce additional arguments by adding them. Let's take a look at examples of types of arguments which can be added to queries.

### Vector search parameters

As you know, Weaviate can search for objects based on their proximity to a vector. This vector can be specified with a variety of parameters, including `nearVector`, `nearObject`, or `nearText` for example. 

These parameters are provided to Weaviate as arguments to the class (e.g. `Get`) in the GraphQL query. 

For example, the below query will add a `nearVector` parameter:

```graphql
{
  Get {
    Question (
      limit: 1,
      nearVector: {vector: <VECTOR>}
      ) {
      question
      answer
    }
  }
}

print(json.dumps(response, indent=2))
```

When a vector for "unusual animals" is used as a the input, the query returns:

```json
{
  "data": {
    "Get": {
      "Question": [
        {
          "answer": "raccoons",
          "question": "The crab-eating one of these masked animals eats fish, fruit & frogs, too"
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

Vector search parameters can also be used with the `Aggregate` and `Explore` functions. They are key inputs that specify the way in which the vector space is searched. We will review these in more detail in a following section of this unit.

### Filters

Filters are used to limit the results of a query to a subset of the data. For example, you might wish to limit the search to a particular category, or perhaps to those questions that have a value greater than a certain threshold.

So, we could modify the above query to only search for questions with a value greater than 100:

```graphql
{
  Get {
    Question (
      limit: 1,
      nearVector: {vector: <VECTOR>},
      where: {
        path: ["value"],
        operator: GreaterThan,
        valueInt: 100,
      }
      ) {
      question
      answer
    }
  }
}
```

The additional `where` filter limits the results here to questions where the `value` property is greater than 100. Our top result is now:

```json
{
  "data": {
    "Get": {
      "Question": [
        {
          "answer": "Zebra",
          "question": "It's the striped African mammal with whom the insect seen here shares part of its name"
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

Filters are available for all functions, and are an important part of your search strategy. We will review these in more detail in a following section of this unit.

### Additional properties

Each GraphQL query can also be extended to request additional properties. These include information such as the `id` or `vector` of the object or a `certainty` value of the search result. 

Weaviate's GraphQL syntax includes a reserved `_additional` field which can be used to request additional properties. The following will request the object's ID along with the `question` and `answer` properties:

```graphql
{
  Get {
    Question (limit: 1) {
      question
      answer
      _additional {
        id
      }
    }
  }
}
```

And it will return:

```json
{
  "data": {
    "Get": {
      "Question": [
        {
          "_additional": {
            "id": "0000d624-976b-5c43-abf3-ec9491ddb1bc"
          },
          "answer": "Amazon.com",
          "question": "On July 16, 1995 this company made its first sale, a science textbook"
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

Additional properties are extremely valuable. They can help to retrieve object IDs or vectors for re-use, or review search results based on their certainty. We will also review these in more detail in a following section of this unit.
