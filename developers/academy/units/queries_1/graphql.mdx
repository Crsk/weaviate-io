## What is GraphQL

You may have already seen that Weaviate utilizes GraphQL as the query language for its searches.

Let's take a look at the basic GraphQL syntax in Weaviate again.  

```graphql
{
  <Function> {
    <Class> {
      <properties>
      _additional {
        <additional_properties>
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Unlike in REST APIs, GraphQL allows the user to specify the data to retrieve - which in this case is specified in the `<properties>` field. This allows the user to only specify the data that is needed. Additionally, the user can specify multiple properties, which means that what might potentially take multiple requests with a REST API can be done in a single query.

These benefits of GraphQL in reducing over-fetching and under-fetching of data is a key reason that it is used by Weaviate.

### GraphQL and Weaviate clients

Weaviate offers client libraries for multiple widely used programming languages in Python, JavaScript, Java, and Go. These client libraries simplify the use of GraphQL syntax by allowing interaction with Weaviate using constructs of the respective native programming language.

The client libraries also give the option to use raw GraphQL queries directly.

In this section, we'll continue to use raw GraphQL queries to deepen your understanding and increase your comfort level with this crucial topic.

## Overview of GraphQL API

The GraphQL functions most commonly used in Weaviate are `Get` and `Aggregate`.

### `Get` objects



### `Aggregate` meta information

### `Explore` vector spaces

## Additional options

- Filters
- Vector search parameters
- Additional properties
