## `Get` queries in Weaviate

In many use cases, retrieving objects from a Weaviate instance may be the most common operation. 

For example, a user may want to retrieve a list of passages most closely related to the input query, or they may wish to retrieve a list of images which are most similar to another image. It may even be possible to retrieve a set of images that best match a given passage.

In Weaviate, these operations are performed using the `Get` function.

## `Get` function syntax

The syntax of a `Get` function is as follows:

```graphql
{
  Get {
    <ClassName> (
      <arguments>
    ) {
      <properties>
    }
  }
}
```

To review the syntax:

- The `ClassName` argument specifies the class of objects to be retrieved. 
- The `arguments` argument specifies the search criteria to be used to retrieve the objects. 
- The `properties` argument specifies the properties of the objects to be retrieved, including any `_additional` properties.

## Retrieving objects 
- Try basic interactive query
- Make sure that they get back the right object(s) back

## Retrieving desired properties
- Try basic interactive query
- Make sure that they get back the right object(s) back

## Retrieving additional properties
- Try basic interactive query
- Make sure that they get back the right object(s) back


## Move these to appropriate places

From an earlier draft of hands on with Weaviate

### Retrieve similarity values

```graphql
{
  Get {
    Question (
      limit: 5
      nearText: {
        concepts: ["Related to seafaring in Scandanavia."],
      }
    ) {
      question 
      answer 
      _additional {
        distance
        id
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Vector searches with filters

```graphql
{
  Get {
    Question (
      limit: 5
      nearText: {
        concepts: ["Related to seafaring in Scandanavia."],
      }
      where: {
        path: ["question"],    
        operator: Like,  
        valueText: "*sail*"
      }      
    ) {
      question 
      answer 
      _additional {
        distance
        id
      }
    }
  }
}
```
