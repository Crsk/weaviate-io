## `Get` queries in Weaviate
- What do `Get` queries do
- What don't `Get` queries do (e.g. contrast with `Aggregate`)

## `Get` syntax overview
- Basic syntax construction
- Try syntax with/without spaces and commas
- Code examples in other languages

## Retrieving objects

- Make sure that they get back the right object(s) back

## Retrieving additional properties
- Try basic interactive query
- Make sure that they get back the right object(s) back


## Move these to appropriate places

From an earlier draft of hands on with Weaviate

### Retrieve similarity values

```graphql
{
  Get {
    Question (
      limit: 5
      nearText: {
        concepts: ["Related to seafaring in Scandanavia."],
      }
    ) {
      question 
      answer 
      _additional {
        distance
        id
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Vector searches with filters

```graphql
{
  Get {
    Question (
      limit: 5
      nearText: {
        concepts: ["Related to seafaring in Scandanavia."],
      }
      where: {
        path: ["question"],    
        operator: Like,  
        valueText: "*sail*"
      }      
    ) {
      question 
      answer 
      _additional {
        distance
        id
      }
    }
  }
}
