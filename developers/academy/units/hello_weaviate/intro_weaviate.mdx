## What is Weaviate?

:::warning TODO

As you may have read on [our homepage](https://weaviate.io/), Weaviate is an open-source vector search engine.

That's a short sentence that packs a lot of domain-specific information. So let's spend some time unpacking it here, bit by bit.

### Open-source

Weaviate is open-source, with its [codebase available online](https://github.com/weaviate/weaviate) for anyone to see and use<sup>[(1)](#1)</sup>. 

And that is **the** codebase, regardless of *how* you use it. So whether you run Weaviate on your own computer, on a cloud compute environment such as AWS or GCP, or simply use it through our managed service [Weaviate Cloud Service, or WCS](https://console.weaviate.io/), you are using the exact same technology.

It also means that your knowledge about Weaviate is fungible, between local, cloud or managed instances of Weaviate. So anything you learn here about Weaviate using WCS will be equally applicable to running it locally, and vice versa. ðŸ˜‰

### Vector search engine

Many of you might know what a vector search engine is, but let's cover it briefly. 

You are probably familiar with the term "search engine". Services like Google, Bing, DuckDuckGo help you to carry out searches (primarily of the Web). The term as well as search engines themselves have become ubiquitous over the last two (2)-plus decades.

A vector search engine is an extension of this concept. A vector search engine is named so because it helps you to retrieve information using "vectors". They do this because it is a **fantastic way of carrying out similarity-based searches**. 

Take a look for yourself at this example of a vector search:

Vector searches are also referred to as "semantic searches", because they return results based on similarity of meaning (therefore "semantic").

## How does Weaviate work?

:::warning TODO
Video here
:::

Weaviate enables vector searches by indexing and storing data objects and corresponding vector embeddings from machine learning models. 

In more plain terms, Weaviate processes and organizes your data in such a way that objects can be retrieved based on their similarity to a query. 

There are a few factors here that are important to point out.

### Quantifying similarity

So far, you've heard from us that vector searches are similarity-based. But we have not yet mentioned how that works, exactly. More specifically, we have yet to discuss what it even means for two vectors, two pieces of text, or two objects in general, to be "similar". 

This is a relatively simple idea that is actually incredibly interesting and intricate once we start to dive into the details. 

But for now, you should know that machine learning (ML) models are key to this whole process. 

#### ML models and vectorization

Weaviate is not itself a vectorizer for creating a vector corresponding to a data object. Instead, it is connectable to modules that can leverage a chosen machine learning model for this purpose.

A machine learning model is what will turn data, like a piece of text, an image, an audio clip, or whatever, into a vector. This type of models are often also referred to as "vectorizers". And any measures of similarity will depend on the particular machine learning model used.

As a result, it is paramount that the right model for the job is chosen. Or, at least, that a wrong model is not chosen. So throughout our courses, you will see many different models and learn about model selection both as rules of thumb and detailed discussions. 

And to help our users leverage the best model for them, Weaviate is built to be compatible with a huge number of vectorization models and services. Our courses will also cover different ways to configure Weaviate so that you are using your preferred model and method in the way that suits your goals and needs.

### Indexing

Traditional databases include an index of the constituent data, typically called an "inverted index", where data is organized based on the constituent components (such as words) for speedy lookup. 

Vector search engines such as Weaviate include a *vector index*, typically in addition to an inverted index. They allow fast information retrieval without compromising the quality of retrieval performance (i.e. at high *recall*). Nonetheless, they are not without cost as the size of the information set increases, and the user must balance memory requirements as well as retrieval times and recall performance.

Weaviate uses a technique called "approximate nearest neighbor" (ANN) algorithm in its indexing which enables it to scale at a sublinear complexity. This means that the rate of increase in search time is less than the rate of increase of the dataset, which is extremely beneficial for scalability.

You will learn about these aspects throughout the course, including the *HNSW* index which is Weaviate's primary vector index type.

### Going to production

Vector databases often need to scale horizontally and vertically. The scale of vector databases can expand into billions of data objects, thus requiring indexing and retrieval of billions of vectors to be retrievable by many concurrent users. 

We appreciate that this presents additional and very different challenges to the data science aspect of vector search. For this reason, we are building units related to taking your Weaviate instance all the way to production.  

All things related to taking Weaviate to production, such as authentication and authorization, backups, monitoring, replication and more will be covered in these units. 

## What else can Weaviate do?

In short, a lot more ðŸ˜….

While Weaviate is primarily a vector search engine, its core functionality powers a lot of other, related functionality, such as question answering, summarization, classification, and named entity recognition. You will see some of these functionalities throughout our courses. 

## Wrap-up

In this section, you learned about what Weaviate is and how it works at a very high level. You have also been introduced to what vector search is at a high level, that it is a similarity-based search method. 

### Wrap-up exercise

Can you describe, in your own sentence, what vector search is?

### Key takeaways

- Weaviate is an open source vector search engine.
- The core Weaviate library the same whether you run it locally, on the cloud, or with WCS.
- Vector searches are similarity-based searches.
- Machine learning models are used to vectorize objects, and in turn define what it means for objects to be "similar".
- Vector databases such as Weaviate include a vector index as well as an inverted index.
