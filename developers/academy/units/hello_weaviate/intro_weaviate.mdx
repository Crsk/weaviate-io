## What is Weaviate?

:::warning TODO

As you may have read on [our homepage](https://weaviate.io/), Weaviate is an open-source vector search engine.

That's a short sentence that packs a lot of information. So let's spend some time unpacking it here, bit by bit.

### Open-source

Weaviate is open-source, which means that its [codebase is available online](https://github.com/weaviate/weaviate) for anyone to see and use<sup>[(1)](#1)</sup>. 

And that is *the* codebase, regardless of how you use it. So whether you run Weaviate on your own computer, on a cloud compute environment, or through our managed service [Weaviate Cloud Service, or WCS](https://console.weaviate.io/), you are using the exact same technology.

It also means that your knowledge about Weaviate is fungible, between local, cloud or managed instances of Weaviate. So anything you learn here about Weaviate using WCS will be equally applicable to running it locally, and vice versa. ðŸ˜‰

### Vector search engine

A vector search engine is an advanced type of search engine that helps you to retrieve information using "vectors". 

Unlike traditional search engines, which return results based on keyword matches, vector search engines return results based on comparisons of vectors, each of which represents an object like a passage of text, a book, or an image. A vector search is a **fantastic way of carrying out a similarity-based search**. 

Take a look for yourself at this example of a vector search:

A vector search is also referred to as a "semantic search", because it returns results based on similarity of meaning (therefore "semantic").

Think of it like searching for a book in a library. Instead of searching for a particular word, like "history", or "penguins" a vector search engines enables searches for books that are similar in theme, tone, or style.

Over the course of this unit, we will see all this works, including:

- What vectors are
- How vectors represent meaning
- How vector similarity can be measured
- How Weaviate performs vector searches

## How does Weaviate work?

:::warning TODO
Video here
:::

Weaviate enables vector searches by indexing and storing data objects and corresponding vector embeddings from machine learning models. 

In more plain terms, Weaviate processes and organizes your data in such a way that objects can be retrieved based on their similarity to a query. 

There are a few factors here that are important to point out.

### Quantifying similarity

As we've mentioned, vector searches are similarity-based, but what does that actually mean? How do we determine that two pieces of data are "similar"? What does it mean for two vectors, two pieces of text, or two objects in general, to be similar?

This is a relatively simple idea that is actually incredibly interesting and intricate once we start to dive into the details. 

But for now, you should know that machine learning (ML) models are key to this whole process. 

#### ML models and vectorization

A machine learning model is what will turn data, like a piece of text, an image, an audio clip, and more into a vector. This type of models are often also referred to as "vectorizers". And measures of similarity will depend on the particular machine learning model used.

As a result, it is paramount that the right model for the job is chosen. Or, at least, that a wrong model is not chosen. So throughout our courses, you will see many different models and learn about model selection both as rules of thumb and detailed discussions. 

Weaviate does not itself vectorize data, but it is built to be compatible with a huge number of vectorization models and services. Our courses will also cover different ways to configure Weaviate to vectorize your data in the way that suits your goals and needs.

### Indexing

To retrieve data quickly and efficiently, Weaviate uses a vector index in addition to an object index. The vector index allows for fast information retrieval, while still maintaining high recall performance. However, as the size of the dataset increases, the memory requirements and retrieval times must be balanced.

Weaviate uses an "approximate nearest neighbor" (ANN) algorithm for its indexing, which enables it to scale at a sublinear complexity. This means that the search time increases at a slower rate than the size of the dataset, making Weaviate highly scalable.

Throughout the course, you'll learn about indexing in Weaviate and the HNSW index, which is Weaviate's primary vector index type.

### Going to production

Vector databases often need to scale horizontally and vertically. The scale of vector databases can expand into billions of data objects, thus requiring indexing and retrieval of billions of vectors to be retrievable by many concurrent users. 

We appreciate that this presents additional and very different challenges to the data science aspect of vector search. To help you navigate these challenges, we'll cover all the key aspects of taking Weaviate to production in dedicated units of the course.

All things related to taking Weaviate to production, such as authentication and authorization, backups, monitoring, replication and more will be covered in these units.

## What else can Weaviate do?

In short, a lot more ðŸ˜….

While Weaviate is primarily a vector search engine, its core functionality powers a lot of other, related functionality, such as question answering, summarization, classification, and named entity recognition. You will see some of these functionalities throughout our courses. 

## Wrap-up

In this section, you learned about what Weaviate is and how it works at a very high level. You have also been introduced to what vector search is at a high level, that it is a similarity-based search method. 

### Wrap-up exercise

Can you describe, in your own sentence, what vector search is?

### Key takeaways

- Weaviate is an open source vector search engine.
- The core Weaviate library the same whether you run it locally, on the cloud, or with WCS.
- Vector searches are similarity-based searches.
- Machine learning models are used to vectorize objects, and in turn define what it means for objects to be "similar".
- Vector databases such as Weaviate include a vector index as well as an inverted index.
