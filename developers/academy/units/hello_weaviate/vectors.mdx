### What is a vector?

In mathematics and sciences, the word "vector" can be used refer to many things. 

A vector in our (data science) context is a set of numbers. If you have seen words like "tensor", or "array", in a similar context they generally refer to the same thing - with perhaps slight differences depending on whether they might be referring to particular software libraries, or the number of dimensions.

To be precise, a vector is **an one-dimensional array of numbers**, such as `1, 5, 5`, `0.591, -0.132, 0, 0.105`, or `0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0`. 

A vector is typically shown as its constituent numbers wrapped in square brackets. So, the above vectors may be typically represented as `[1, 5, 5]`, `[0.591, -0.132, 0, 0.105]` and `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]` respectively.

### How can a vector represent meaning?

A vector itself is a relatively small concept. It's a collection, or a one-dimensional array, of numbers. This may not seem like much in itself. But the real power of vectors comes from the fact that they can be used to represent meaning. So how can a series of numbers represent meaning?

#### Everyday examples of vectors

One way to think about it is that each number in a vector represents a particular aspect of meaning. Then, the vector itself represents the combination of all of these aspects. 

In fact, many of you may have already used vectors to describe aspects of meaning. For example, you may have used a vector to:
- Describe the position of an object in space by sending a location pin to somebody. This is a vector that contains numbers for the latitude and longitude, or
- Describe the color of an object by a vector of numbers that represent the red, green and blue (and perhaps transparency) components of the color.

In each of these examples, each number in the vector represents a particular aspect of the object, such as its longitude or how green the object is. The entire vector combines these aspects to represent the "meaning", such as its location or its color.

Extending this idea, the above two vectors might be combined to one vector that contains its latitude, longitude, red, green, blue and transparency. This vector would then represent the object's location and color. 

In other words, a vector can represent any property of an object by enumerating a property such as how far north it is, how far west it is, how red it is, how green it is, how blue it is, and how transparent it is.

#### Vectors for semantic representation

The semantic use of vectors extends this idea further to represent meaning of words, sentences, or even entire documents. 

Again, each number in a vector represents a particular aspect of meaning. Imagine how you would try to represent words like "lion", "grapefruit", "cat" and "cow". You might have each numbers within a vector capture different aspects, such as:
- How "furry" the object is
- How "big" the object is
- How "dangerous" the object is
- How "edible" the object is

And so on.

Then, the vector itself would represent the combination of all of these aspects. So, a vector for the word "lion" might be `[0.8, 0.9, 0.9, 0.1]`, while a vector for the word "grapefruit" might be `[0.1, 0.3, 0.1, 0.9]`.

Each number in a vector represents a particular aspect of meaning, and the entire vector represents the combination of all of these aspects.

A "real" vector that is generated by modern language models are simply longer. A vector that is used to represent the word "lion" might have a much longer length, such as hundreds or thousands of numbers, but the idea is the same. Each number represents some aspect of a meaning, and the resulting entire vector can be used to represent the meaning of the word.

#### How are vectors actually generated?

![](https://media.istockphoto.com/id/1091751808/vector/technology-and-packing-concept-in-flat-style-industrial-machine-vector-illustration.jpg?s=1024x1024&w=is&k=20&c=8PwZznTBkQvTlHjLdGWcVynN3CPKIzHzRj9TDMg5uVw=)

Vectors are generated by machine learning models. These models are trained on large amounts of data, and are able to learn the relationships between words and their meanings.

These models use the training data to infer relationships between words and their meanings. For example, a model might learn that the word "lion" is similar to the word "tiger" because they are both big cats. It might also learn that the word "lion" is similar to the word "cow" because they are both animals. And then, they use this knowledge to find-tune individual numbers in vectors such that they best represent the meaning of the words.

This is why choosing the right model is so important. The model you choose will have a significant impact on the quality of the vectors, and what it means to be "similar" to another word. 

A model that is trained based on how words are used in everyday English is going to be different from a model that is trained on how words are used in scientific papers, or in particular domains such as medicine or law.

We will cover this in more detail elsewhere in the course, in regards to how to choose the right model for your use case.

### How does vector search work?

![](https://media.istockphoto.com/id/960232534/photo/numbers-fell-down-i.jpg?s=612x612&w=is&k=20&c=_m-x-D369t2LXO30XaLr__ZVXUB--s-vN_vK2kv6TqE=)

Earlier on, we mentioned that a vector can be used to represent the meaning of a word. In an earlier section, we also mentioned that a vector search is a fantastic way of carrying out similarity-based searches. 

You can probably see how these two ideas converge. A vector search relies on these numerical representation of meaning to carry out similarity-based searches. The closer two vectors are to each other, the more similar the words they represent.

A vector search therefore works by providing a vector-based query object to a vector search engine. The vector search engine then returns a list of results that are most similar to the query object.

It may be that a vector search engine takes as input an object such as a text passage or an image which it converts to a vector. Or it may receive a vector as the query object directly. 

### How is vector similarity measured?

Broadly speaking, vector similarity measures how close the two sets of numbers that make up each vector are to each other. Depending on your relationship with linear algebra, this may sound like a very abstract concept. 

But the intuition is this: the closer the two vectors are to each other, the more similar the words they represent.

In practice, there are many different ways to measure vector similarity. The most common methods include: 
- Cosine similarity
- Euclidean distance
- Dot product
- Manhattan distance

The choice of similarity measure will depend on the use case and the model. In Weaviate, the default metric unless specified is `cosine similarity`. We will cover these choices in more detail in another section.

## What is a semantic search?

![](https://media.istockphoto.com/id/1290482722/vector/people-taking-documents-from-shelves.jpg?s=612x612&w=is&k=20&c=DW8oveHrghOYNxC0xilZDqpq38bfBE_RuyJ6o7UIk-8=)

"Semantic" refers to something being "related to meaning". It is often used in the field of linguistics (study of languages) to contrast to "syntactic", which refers to structure or grammar. Thus "semantic search" refers to a search that is based on meaning.

Vector search is currently the dominant way of performing semantic searches. Accordingly, we will use the terms "semantic search" and "vector search" interchangeably in this course unless otherwise specified.

### What is a lexical search?

Traditional search systems use "lexical" searches, based on a "vocabulary" of the search system or database at hand.

A lexical search relies on matching exact strings or substrings and using various operators to manipulate sets of information that either meets or does not meet certain criteria. 

For example, looking through a database of recipes to retrieve all objects containing the ingredient "chili" is an example of a lexical search. You might typically combine multiple conditions, so that for example the below entry would look for entries that where added after the year 2010.

```sql
SELECT * FROM recipe_table WHERE (ingredients LIKE '%chili%') AND (entry_year > 2010)
```

While this enquiry will return an exact answer, it suffers from being  inflexible. 

For one, it would not retrieve recipes where another string is used (e.g. `ghost pepper`) that is synonymous (has the same meaning) with chili. It would also not handle typos well, for example if the entry was mislabelled as `chilli`, or if the entry was mistyped as such. 

On the other hand, semantic searches manage these issues with a little more nuance.

:::note Jargon ("lexical", "semantic", "syntactic")
We try to avoid jargon unless necessary. But where we do use them, we will include explanations for those who have not encountered them.

Because vector search as we use them has some roots in *natural language processing*, terms like *lexical* and *semantic* are commonly used. These are terms that come from linguistics which are used commonly in vector search context. The term *vector* comes from the world of mathematics, as you will see later on. ðŸ¤“

### Vector search vs lexical searches

When facing a query of a recipes database with the word `chili` for ingredients, a vector search engine returns entities that include that exact word in the recipe data. 

This means that a search for `chili` would include in its results entities with semantically related terms such as `ghost pepper`, `jalapeno`, `habanero` or `carolina reaper`, all of which would be ignored by a lexical search.

A modern vector search engine can also take the context into account, such as the context of a word as a part of its parent sentence. So a vector search will differentiate between whether the recipe calls for these ingredients, or whether the recipe asks the cook to "*not* use any chili". 

Also importantly, a vector search engine can determine the degree of similarity between items, such as between a query and each result. Accordingly, the results can be ranked by a meaningful metric that describes the degree of similarity, thereby improving the chance of finding more relevant results faster.
