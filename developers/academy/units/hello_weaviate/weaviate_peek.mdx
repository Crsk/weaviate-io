Outline key pieces of the puzzle that makes Weaviate tick. These are all "teaser" paragraphs that introduce these concepts to provide context for later on.

Learn about: Weaviate's vector storage and search capabilities.
Skills: Outline how a vector database works.

## Introduction

## Search implementation in Weaviate

### Indexes

Describe index types in Weaviate, and what they do.

:::note TODO

:::

### ANN

Describe what ANN is, why it exists, and how they help perform vector searches.

:::note TODO

:::

### (Pre-)Filtering

Describe how filtering works in Weaviate, whether it is a pre- or post-filter, why this matters.

:::note TODO

:::

## Data structure

### Objects

Outline how objects are stored in Weaviate, how Classes and Cross-references work

:::note TODO

:::

### Schema

Outline the role of schemas in Weaviate, how/where to construct it, auto-schemas. More detail to come in the unit on schemas.

:::note TODO

:::

#### Data types

List data types available - and mention broadly why it matters to pick the right types (e.g. vectorization, changes to indexing behaviour).

:::note TODO

:::

## Vectors in Weaviate

Broadly describe where vectors can come from. They can be imported (BYO), or generated by way of Weaviate. Can even use a mix of the two (specify a vectorizer and import).

### Vectorizer modules

- Introduce the idea of vectorizer modules
- Introduce inference API / dockerized transformer containers

:::note TODO

:::

### BYO vectors

- Can upload vectors too.
- Can upload vectors AND use a vectorizer

:::note TODO

:::

## Modules

Broadly describe the module system / architecture. Highlight that there are a ton of modules available and can make custom modules.
